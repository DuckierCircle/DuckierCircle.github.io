                Water buffalos are domesticated bovines that are native to Southeast Asia, but are now found all over the world. They are highly valued for their strength, resilience, and ability to adapt to various climates and environments. Water buffalos are an important source of food and labor for many rural communities, and are often used for plowing fields, carrying heavy loads, and producing milk, meat, and leather.
